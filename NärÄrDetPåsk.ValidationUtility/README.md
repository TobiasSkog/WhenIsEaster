## ValidationUtility
This is a library I created to be helpful during my time studying to a system developer at Edugrade.
It is design to help get correct inputs from the user and currently have functionalitys for these kind of variables:
 - int
 - double
 - bool
 - char
 - String
 - DateTime
 - List
 - Stack
 - Exceptions
 - Limited Password Creater that should not be used for any real project!
 - Keyboard for windows users it can warn you if you have Capslock or Numlock toggled
